# üöÄ How to Deploy the Azure Resources with Bicep

This guide walks you through deploying Azure resources, including a Container Registry, Key Vault, and Application Insights, using a Bicep template and Azure CLI. It assumes you have an .env file containing the necessary environment variables.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and logged in to your Azure account. [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- An Azure subscription where you have permissions to create resources.
- A .env file with your project's environment variables defined.

#### Creating a Service Principal

Before you can create a service principal, make sure you have met all the prerequisites above. Once you have, follow these steps:

1. **Login to Azure**

    Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

Follow the instructions to complete the login process.

2. **Create a Resource Group (if not existent)**

    To create a resource group if it doesn't exist, you can use the following Azure CLI command:

    ```bash
    az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location <location>
    ```

    Replace `<location>` with the desired location for your resource group.

3. **Create a Service Principal (if not existent)**

    Run the following command:

    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ServicePrincipalName
    ```

    Replace `ServicePrincipalName` with a name for your service principal. This command will output a JSON object with your service principal credentials.

4. **Assign a Role to the Service Principal**

    By default, the new service principal has no permissions in your Azure subscription. You need to assign a role to the service principal to give it access to resources in your subscription.

    To assign the Contributor role to your service principal, run:

    ```bash
    az role assignment create --assignee $CLIENT_ID --role Contributor --scope /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP
    ```

    Replace `CLIENT_ID` with the CLIENT_ID of your service principal, `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with your subscription ID, and `RESOURCE_GROUP` with your resource group name.

    > **Note:** If you're using Git Bash on Windows and encountering issues with path translation, you can use the following workaround. Git Bash automatically translates Unix-style paths to Windows paths, which can cause issues with Azure CLI commands. To temporarily disable this path translation for a command, set the `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` environment variable to `1`:

    ```bash
    MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 az role assignment create --assignee $CLIENT_ID --role Contributor --scope /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/
    ```
    In this command, MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 disables path translation, allowing the Azure CLI command to run correctly.

    That's it! You've created a service principal and assigned it a role in your Azure subscription.

## üåç Environment Variables

Your .env file should contain the following variables:

```makefile
PROJECT_NAME=yourProjectName
ENVIRONMENT=yourEnvironment
TENANT_ID=yourTenantId
CLIENT_ID=yourClientId
CLIENT_SECRET=yourClientSecret
```

Replace yourProjectName, yourEnvironment, yourTenantId, yourClientId, and yourClientSecret with appropriate values for your project.

## üö¶ Steps for Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy your Azure resources using the Bicep template:

1. **Set up your environment variables:** Ensure your `.env` file is in the current directory and contains the necessary variables. These variables will be used as parameters for your Bicep deployment.

2. **Load environment variables:** Depending on your operating system, the command to load your environment variables from the `.env` file may vary.

    - For Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS), you can use:

        ```bash
        export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
        ```

    - For Windows systems, you might need to manually set each environment variable using:

        ```powershell
        $env:PROJECT_NAME="indexingapp"
        $env:ENVIRONMENT="dev"
        $env:RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-applications-$env:ENVIRONMENT"
        ```

3. **Authenticate with Azure:** Before deploying your Bicep template, authenticate with Azure using your service principal. Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    az login --service-principal -u $CLIENT_ID -p $CLIENT_SECRET --tenant $TENANT_ID
    ```

    This command authenticates you with Azure using the service principal credentials defined in your `.env` file. It's crucial to ensure that the service principal has the necessary permissions to create and manage resources in your Azure subscription.

    > **Note:** As an alternative, you could use `az login` for interactive login. However, using a service principal is recommended for automation scenarios as it allows for non-interactive, script-based authentication.

4. **Deploy the Bicep template:** Navigate to the directory containing your Bicep file (`yourBicepFileName.bicep`) and run the following Azure CLI command to start the deployment:

        ```bash
        az deployment group create \
            --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
            --template-file yourBicepFileName.bicep \
            --parameters projectName=$PROJECT_NAME environment=$ENVIRONMENT version=$VERSION
        ```

Remember to replace `yourBicepFileName.bicep` with the actual name of your Bicep file.

4. **Check the deployment output:** After the deployment completes, you can find the output values such as the Container Registry login server, Key Vault URI, and Application Insights Instrumentation Key printed in the terminal. These outputs can be used for further configurations or integrations.

Remember to replace `yourBicepFileName.bicep` with the actual name of your Bicep file and ensure all placeholders (`<YourResourceGroupName>`, `yourProjectName`, `yourEnvironment`) are replaced with actual values before executing the commands.

## üîç Verifying the Deployment

Once the deployment is complete, it's important to verify that the resources were created successfully. You can do this in two ways:

1. **Azure Portal:** Navigate to the Azure Portal and check your resource group. You should see the newly created resources, including the Container Registry, Key Vault, and Application Insights.

2. **Azure CLI:** Alternatively, you can use the Azure CLI to query the resources. Here are some example commands for each resource:

    - **Container Registry:**

    ```bash
    az acr show --name $containerRegistryName --query loginServer --output tsv
    ```

    - **Key Vault:**

    ```bash
    az keyvault show --name $keyVaultName --query properties.vaultUri --output tsv
    ```

    - **Application Insights:**

    ```bash
    az monitor app-insights component show --app $applicationInsightsName --query connectionString --output tsv
    ```

Remember to replace `$containerRegistryName`, `$keyVaultName`, and `$applicationInsightsName` with the actual names of your resources.

# üéâ Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully navigated through the process of deploying Azure resources using a Bicep template and Azure CLI. This guide provided a step-by-step approach, utilizing environment variables from a .env file for configuration.

For further exploration and more detailed information on Bicep and Azure CLI, don't hesitate to refer to the [official Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/).

Before you go, remember to replace `yourBicepFileName.bicep` with the actual name of your Bicep file. Also, ensure all placeholders (`<YourResourceGroupName>`, `yourProjectName`, `yourEnvironment`) are replaced with actual values before executing the commands.
